# CSE 6324-ADVANCED TOPICS IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT
## PROJECT VISION
Our  vision includes a stepwiseprocess which includes usage of RICO UI view hierarchy and parse the JSON files, and then implement a technique  to transform  JSON  files  to React  Native  files.
## DATASET LINK
https://interactionmining.org/rico - The dataset that we have used contains UI screenshots and view hierarchies. 
## TECH STACK USED: 
1. Python 3 
2. Jupyter Notebook 
3. Pycharm IDE
## INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE
1.	Download the RICO UI Screenshot and View Hierarchy dataset from the RICO website [7]
2.	Extract the zipper folder
3.	Choose a JSON file 
4.	Go to our project GitHub library
5.	Download ‘JSON_React_Converter_Iteration3.py’ 
6.	Copy the path of JSON file and pass it in the ‘filepath’ variable.
7.	Pass the number of JSON file, that is desired to be converted.
8.	Create a folder named "Cropped_images" inside the project directory. 
9.	Pass the folder to store cropped images
10. Give a location on your PC to save the converted React Native code, using the function named ‘createReactCode’.
11. Prerequisites to run React Native code
    * Install Node.js(https://nodejs.org/en/) on Local PC
    * Install Expo-cli(https://docs.expo.dev/)
    * Create a new expo project and paste the generated React Native code in the file named ‘App.js
12 Then go to command prompt or terminal of your editor and give any of the commands ‘npm start’ or ‘yarn start’ to open the simulator.
13.	Select the option ‘Run in Web browser’ to have a browser view.
14.	And to view it in mobile, install the App ‘Expo-go’(for IOS) or ‘Expo’( for Android) and scan the barcode.
